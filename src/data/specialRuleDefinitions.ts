  "Cancel a Die": "When a rule allows you to cancel a die from a roll, select the desired die from all those rolled and remove it before proceeding to the switches step. All symbols rolled on the selected die are completely ignored, as if it had not been rolled.",
  "Cancel a Symbol": "When a rule allows you to cancel a symbol from a roll, select the one you want from all the symbols obtained when rolling the dice (including automatic symbols) before proceeding to the switches step. The selected symbol should be ignored as if it had not been obtained.",
  "Repeat a Die": "When a rule or effect allows you to reroll a die from your roll, you can reroll any die you want. You will need to do this after rolling the dice for the first time and before advancing to the switches step.\n\nWhen a rule or effect forces you to reroll a die, you must reroll a die that meets the indicated requirements.",
  "Repeat a Roll": "A rule or effect can allow or force you to reroll a roll. In that case, roll all the dice again, before advancing to the switches step.",
  "Fix a Die": "When an effect allows you to \"fix a die\", before rolling your dice, you may select one of your die sides. You then roll the rest of your dice pool and calculate the result, using the chosen face on your fixed die as if that die had rolled that face naturally.",
  "Shove": "The target unit must distance itself from your unit by making a movement of X strides in the direction that joins the center of the opponent's troop leaders base to the center of your troop leaders base. This movement does not cause an opportunity attack.\n\nIf the target unit comes into contact with a unit or an Impassable terrain element while moving, it will stop its movement right at that point.\n\nThis move allows the target unit to engage in combat (it is not considered to have charged).",
  "Attract": "The target unit must approach your unit by making a movement of X strides in the direction that joins the center of the opponents troop leaders base to the center of your troop leaders base. This movement does not cause an opportunity attack.\n\nIf the target unit comes into contact with a unit or an Impassable terrain element while moving, it will stop its movement right at that point.\n\nIf the targeted unit gets in touch with your unit, they will be engaged in combat (but we do not consider it has charged).",
  "Place": "Indicate a point on the battlefield X strides from your unit's troop leader. Whoever controls the target unit must take their troop leader and place it on the designated point. You must then place the rest of the target unit's troops into formation with it.\n\nThe placed unit does not provoke opportune attacks.\n\nRemember that you cannot place models on top of other models, and you cannot place a unit on an Impassable terrain feature.\n\nYou can place the target unit engaged in combat with another unit (it is not considered to have charged).",
  "Displace": "The unit you displace must make a straight movement of X strides in the direction you indicate. The effects of Terrain elements cannot affect this move (except Impassable). This movement does not cause an opportunity attack.\n\nIf when displacing the unit it comes into contact with a unit or an Impassable terrain element, stop its movement right at that point.\n\nYou can displace a unit to engage it in combat (it is not considered to have charged).",
  "Collide": "When a shoved, attracted or displaced unit stops its movement by coming into contact with an Impassable terrain element, we say that they collide.",
  "Aim": "Your unit can re-roll its ranged attack rolls. The target unit of your ranged attack cannot benefit from Cover(D).",
  "Ambusher": "Ambusher units wait in hiding, ready to move into action once the battle has already started, striking by surprise. If you want, you can keep your Ambusher units secret and not deploy them until after you have started the game.\n\nYou can activate your Ambusher unit during your turn instead of activating another unit, as if your Ambushers were on the battlefield. In this case, do the following:\n\n• Deploy it on the battlefield:\n» At any point in your deployment area. You can deploy it engaged in combat with an enemy unit. It is considered to have charged, but the enemy unit cannot hold and fire.\n» Anywhere on the battlefield, except your opponent's deployment zone, and as long as no enemy units within 10 strides have Line of Sight to it.\n• Then activate it.",
  "Berserker Rage": "Your unit can inflict 1L on itself to add a symbol of your choice to an attack, defense, or willpower roll. You must do this after rolling the dice and before advancing to the switches step.\n\nYou cannot deal damage if it means eliminating the unit. This damage is not taken into account when resolving a combat.",
  "Bloodlust": "If your unit is not engaged in combat when activated, it is forced to Charge an enemy unit indicated by 'X', whenever possible. 'X' can be the name of a unit, a keyword or groups of them separated by lines ('|'). If no 'X' value is specified, this unit must Charge the nearest enemy unit.\n\nIf your unit charges due to its Bloodlust, it can re-roll all of its attack rolls while engaged with the enemy unit (not just while charging).\n\nAt the beginning of its activation, your unit can ignore the effects of Bloodlust until the end of its activation by passing a WP test.",
  "Cover": "Units adjacent to this unit (allied or not) can benefit from cover against a ranged attack. The 'D' value indicates the automatic dice or symbols that adjacent units add to their defense roll.",
  "Dispel": "When this unit is targeted by a spell it can attempt to block it. The 'D' value indicates the dice or automatic symbols that must be rolled to block the spell. This unit does not gain tinge by Hollow Shields obtained. Remember that you cannot attempt to block a spell more than once or with more than one unit.",
  "Elite": "Once the dice have been rolled (rerolls included) and before advancing to the switches step, your unit may replace any Hollow Success with Success, any Hollow Shield with Shield, and any Hollow Special with a Special.\n\nThis effect applies to any rolls your unit makes.",

  "Intimidating": "When this unit engages in combat, the enemy unit must perform a WP test in which they must obtain at least as many Success as indicated by 'N' to avoid stress. For every unobtained Success, they'll have to gain stress.",
  "Large": "• Large units can move through units that are not Large. The unit you move through must pass a WP test to avoid stress. In addition, the unit through which it has moved must Face to Face roll its defense against as many Success as there are troops in said unit (up to a maximum of 3) and will suffer as much damage as Success not canceled.\n• Even if engaged in combat, your unit can charge a different unit if it has LoS to it and can move to engage. This charge move will provoke an opportune attack.\n• Only other Large units and terrain elements with the LoS Block keyword can block LoS to Large units.\n• Large units are Immovable.",
  "Manned": "• Your unit ignores the effects of Intimidating.\n• It only becomes stressed when activated more than once during the same round.",
  "Preferred Terrain": "Your unit can ignore the effects of any keywords on terrain elements indicated by 'E', which can indicate one type of terrain element, one keyword, or several groups of them separated by lines ('|').\n\nFor example, preferred terrain (Forest, Rugged | Lake) would allow your unit to ignore the effects of any keywords from all forests with the Rugged keyword or from all lakes.\n\nAdditionally, if your unit is adjacent to the terrain element at the start of its activation, add 2 strides to its first MOV value and its charge movement.\n\nFor example, if your unit has MOV 4-3 (10), it will have MOV 6-3 (12) during the activation that begins adjacent to its preferred terrain.",
  "Raging": "Your unit adds a Success to its attack rolls when it charges.",
  "Scout": "Scout units can deploy right after all other units on both sides have finished deploying. In this way, they represent that they are advance guards that have recognized the terrain or the enemy and choose the best position.\nIf your opponent also has Scout units, whoever has the initiative decides who deploys one of their Scout units first. You and your opponent must alternate until you have deployed all of them.\nYou can also keep your Scout unit secret and deploy it once the game has started. The restrictions to deploy it are as follows:\n\n• You can deploy your Scout unit anywhere in your deployment zone (it cannot be deployed engaged in combat).\n• You can deploy your Scout unit adjacent to one of the battlefield edges, as long as you do not enter your opponent's deployment zone and no enemy units within 12 strides have Line of Sight to it.\n\nIf you decide to deploy it once the game has started, you must activate it immediately and consume one of the two actions for its activation. Thus, it will only be able to perform one action that is not long.",
  "Heal": "If an effect allows you to \"heal XL\" from a unit, remove a maximum number of damage tokens from it as indicated by 'X'.",
  "Recover": "If an effect allows you to \"recover X troops\" from a unit, take as many models that are out of combat as indicated by X and place them on the battlefield in formation with their unit.\n\nA unit cannot recover troops above its starting number (should the unit have a Character joined, do not include them in the counting).",
  "Officer": "Remember that Officer type Characters count towards the total number of troops in their unit.",

  "Vulnerable": "Your unit must cancel one die from its defense rolls in which it has rolled at least one Block. In the case of multiple dice, your opponent will choose which one. You must apply this effect after rolling the dice (with all possible repetitions), but just before starting the Switches step.\nRemove this state at the end of the activation in which you have applied its effects (if you have not been able to cancel any dice, the state is considered to remain active).",
  "Frightened": "Your unit must re-roll all of its successful Willpower Tests (maximum once per test). Remove this state when you pass a willpower test.",
  "Slowed": "Your unit cannot use its second movement value (MOV) when performing the move and assault actions. Additionally, you must subtract 4 strides from your charge movement (up to a minimum value of 0). For example, if your unit has movement 3-2 (9), it can only move 3 and can only move 5 when it charges.\n\nRemove this state at the end of the activation in which your unit performs the action move or assault.",
  "Disarmed": "Your unit must cancel one die from its attack rolls in which it has obtained at least one Success. In the case of multiple dice, your opponent will choose which one.

  "Flee": "If your unit flees, you must immediately move it using both of its MOV values towards your deployment zone, following the shortest possible path and, if it is already there, move it towards the nearest edge of the battlefield. When a fleeing unit comes into contact with one of the battlefield edges, remove it. The unit will count as eliminated for all purposes.\n\nFor a unit to be considered to have entered your deployment zone, all its troops must have bases completely within the zone's limits. It is enough for one of them to touch the border of the battlefield for the unit to leave the battlefield.\n\nFlee movement does not generate an opportunity attack.",
  "Block LoS": "The element blocks all Lines of Sight drawn through it, as well as LoS drawn from within it and those drawn into it. Unless a terrain feature has this keyword, it is never considered to block LoS.\n\nTerrain features do not block LoS unless they have the Block LoS keyword.",
  "Rugged": "Units defined by 'X' receive the slowed state at any moment they are adjacent to the terrain element during their activation. In addition, these units cannot declare charge if the charge movement would take the unit adjacent to the terrain element at any point of its trajectory.\n\n'X' can be the name of a unit, a characteristic, a keyword, or several groups of them separated by lines ('|'). If no 'X' value is specified, the effect is applicable to all units.",
  "Trap": "This terrain feature has been created by a unit using a skill or spell. Units that can remove traps can remove this terrain element from the battlefield."
