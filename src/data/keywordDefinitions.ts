  "Aim": "Your unit can re-roll its ranged attack rolls. The target unit of your ranged attack cannot benefit from Cover(D).",
  "Ambusher": "Ambusher units wait in hiding, ready to move into action once the battle has already started, striking by surprise. If you want, you can keep your Ambusher units secret and not deploy them until after you have started the game.\n\nYou can activate your Ambusher unit during your turn instead of activating another unit, as if your Ambushers were on the battlefield. In this case, do the following:\n\nDeploy it on the battlefield:\nAt any point in your deployment area. You can deploy it engaged in combat with an enemy unit. It is considered to have charged, but the enemy unit cannotb hold and fire.\nAnywhere on the battlefield, except your opponent's deployment zone, and as long as no enemy units within 10 strides have Line of Sight to it.\nThen activate it.",
  "Attract (X)": "The target unit must approach your unit by making a movement of X strides in the direction that joins the center of the opponents troop leaders base to the center of your troop leaders base. This movement does not cause an opportunity attack.\n\nIf the target unit comes into contact with a unit or an Impassable terrain element while moving, it will stop its movement right at that point.\n\nIf the targeted unit gets in touch with your unit, they will be engaged in combat (but we do not consider it has charged).",
  "Berserker Rage": "Your unit can inflict 1 wound on itself to add a symbol of your choice to an attack, defense, or willpower roll. You must do this after rolling the dice and before advancing to the switches step.\n\nYou cannot deal damage if it means eliminating the unit. This damage is not taken into account when resolving a combat.",
  "Block LoS": "The element blocks all Lines of Sight drawn through it, as well as LoS drawn from within it and those drawn into it. Unless a terrain feature has this keyword, it is never considered to block LoS.\n\nTerrain features do not block LoS unless they have the Block LoS keyword.",
  "Bloodlust": "If your unit is not engaged in combat when activated, it is forced to Charge an enemy unit indicated by 'X', whenever possible. 'X' can be the name of a unit, a keyword or groups of them separated by lines ('|'). If no 'X' value is specified, this unit must Charge the nearest enemy unit.\n\nIf your unit charges due to its Bloodlust, it can re-roll all of its attack rolls while engaged with the enemy unit (not just while charging).\n\nAt the beginning of its activation, your unit can ignore the effects of Bloodlust until the end of its activation by passing a WP test.",
  "Character": "Characters are single miniature units that feature the Character keyword in their profile. Depending on the strength of their leadership or their role in your company, we distinguish between Officers and Supports.",
  "Cover": "Units adjacent to this terrain feature can benefit from cover from a ranged attack. The 'D' value indicates the automatic dice or symbols that adjacent units add to their defense roll.",
  "Dispel": "When this unit is targeted by a spell it can attempt to block it. The 'D' value indicates the dice or automatic symbols that must be rolled to block the spell. This unit does not gain tinge by Hollow Shields obtained. Remember that you cannot attempt to block a spell more than once or with more than one unit.",
  "Displace (X)": "The unit you displace must make a straight movement of X strides in the direction you indicate. The effects of Terrain elements cannot affect this move (except Impassable). This movement does not cause an opportunity attack. \n\nIf when displacing the unit it comes into contact with a unit or an Impassable terrain element, stop its movement right at that point. \n\nYou can displace a unit to engage it in combat (it is not considered to have charged).",
  "Elite": "Once the dice have been rolled (rerolls included) and before advancing to the switches step, your unit may replace any Hollow Success with Success, any Hollow Shield with Shield, and any Hollow Special with a Special.\n\nThis effect applies to any rolls your unit makes.",
  "Fearless": "Your unit ignores the effects of Intimidating and is immune to the frightened status.",
  "High Command": "If you include one of them in your company, they automatically become your commander.\n\nYou cannot add two or more Characters with High Command to your company.",
  "Immovable": "Your unit cannot be attracted, shoved, placed, displaced, or pushed back unless you want it to.",
  "Join": "Characters with the ability to join a unit have it indicated in their profile using the keyword Join (X), where 'X' can be the name of a unit, a characteristic, a keyword or several groups of them separated by lines ('|'). In the latter case, the target unit must have all the keywords or characteristics, or be named as at least one of the groups.\n\nCharacters who do not have the Join (X) keyword cannot join any unit in any way.\n\nA unit cannot include more than one Character.",
  "Preferred Terrain": "Your unit can ignore the effects of any keywords on terrain elements indicated by 'E', which can indicate one type of terrain element, one keyword, or several groups of them separated by lines ('|').\n\nFor example, preferred terrain (Forest, Rugged | Lake) would allow your unit to ignore the effects of any keywords from all forests with the Rugged keyword or from all lakes.\n\nAdditionally, if your unit is adjacent to the terrain element at the start of its activation, add 2 strides to its first MOV value and its charge movement.\n\nFor example, if your unit has MOV 4-3 (10), it will have MOV 6-3 (12) during the activation that begins adjacent to its preferred terrain.",
  "Raging": "Your unit adds a Success to its attack rolls when it charges.",
  "Scout": "Scout units can deploy right after all other units on both sides have finished deploying. In this way, they represent that they are advance guards that have recognized the terrain or the enemy and choose the best position.\nIf your opponent also has Scout units, whoever has the initiative decides who deploys one of their Scout units first. You and your opponent must alternate until you have deployed all of them.\nYou can also keep your Scout unit secret and deploy it once the game has started. The restrictions to deploy it are as follows:\n\n• You can deploy your Scout unit anywhere in your deployment zone (it cannot be deployed engaged in combat).\n• You can deploy your Scout unit adjacent to one of the battlefield edges, as long as you do not enter your opponent's deployment zone and no enemy units within 12 strides have Line of Sight to it.\n\nIf you decide to deploy it once the game has started, you must activate it immediately and consume one of the two actions for its activation. Thus, it will only be able to perform one action that is not long.",
  "Shove (X)": "The target unit must distance itself from your unit by making a movement of X strides in the direction that joins the center of the opponent's troop leaders base to the center of your troop leaders base. This movement does not cause an opportunity attack.\n\nIf the target unit comes into contact with a unit or an Impassable terrain element while moving, it will stop its movement right at that point. \n\nThis move allows the target unit to engage in combat (it is not considered to have charged).",
  "Spellcaster": "Units with the Spellcaster keyword have the ability to manipulate magical energy to cast the spells listed on their game profile.\n\nIf your unit only has the Spellcaster keyword, it can only cast the spells described in its game profile.",
  "Golem": "• Your unit ignores the effects of Intimidating.\n• Your unit is immune to the effects of the frightened state.\n• Your unit cannot be demoralized. If you are stressed above your MOR value, you ignore the excess stress.",
  "Large": "• Large units can move through units that are not Large. The unit you move through must pass a WP test to avoid stress. In addition, the unit through which it has moved must Face to Face roll its defense against as many Success as there are troops in said unit (up to a maximum of 3) and will suffer as much damage as Success not canceled.\n• Even if engaged in combat, your unit can charge a different unit if it has LoS to it and can move to engage. This charge move will provoke an opportune attack.\n• Only other Large units and terrain elements with the LoS Block keyword can block LoS to Large units.\n• Large units are Immovable.",
  "Intimidating": "When this unit engages in combat, the enemy unit must perform a WP test in which they must obtain at least as many Success as indicated by 'X' to avoid stress. For every unobtained Success, they'll have to gain stress."
